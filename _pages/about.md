I am a fourth year PhD student advised by [Milind Tambe](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/directory/mtambe). Starting in Fall 2019, I will be a PhD student in the Harvard University School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (previously, our lab was affiliated with USC). I work on optimization and machine learning for social impact. My [recent](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13732) [technical](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/wang19e/wang19e.pdf) [work](files/aaai_melding.pdf) focuses on integrating algorithms for discrete optimization into deep learning models, enabling end-to-end training of systems that combine prediction and decision making. I've also worked on optimization and active learning for interventions that use social networks to disseminate information. My ultimate goal is to enable improved decision making under uncertainty, particularly for interventions that serve vulnerable populations. Applications include a recent project on [tuberculosis treatment in India](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.01506), as well as a longer-running project on [HIV prevention for homeless youth](files/aamas_deployment.pdf). Our algorithmically-driven HIV intervention is currently being piloted by Los Angeles-area homeless centers, with preliminary results showing large improvement compared to status quo techniques.

I coordinate the MD4SG Working Group on Global Perspectives on Inequality and co-organize the Computational Sustainability Online Graduate Seminar. I am supported by a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship.
